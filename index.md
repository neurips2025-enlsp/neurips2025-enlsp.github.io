The fourth version of the Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing (ENLSP-IV) workshop will focus on how to make large language and foundation models more efficient in terms of <b>Architecture</b>, <b>Training</b>, and <b>Inference</b> in their real-world applications. This year, following the trend of industry and academia, we put more emphasis on investigating new architectures to make future language and foundation models more efficient. Moreover, we highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking new efficient models from different practical aspects. 
The workshop program offers an interactive platform for gathering experts and talents from academia and industry through invited talks, panel discussion, paper submission, reviews, interactive poster sessions, oral presentations and a couple of mentorship sessions for new researchers.
This will be a unique opportunity to discuss and share challenging problems, build connections,  exchange ideas and brainstorm, and foster future collaborations. The topics of this workshop can be of interest for people working on general machine learning, deep learning, hardware, optimization, theory and applications.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
As large language models (e.g. <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf">GPT-3</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774"> GPT-4</a>, <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama3/"> Llama 3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10403">PALM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805">Gemini</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10845">Pangu-âˆ‘</a>), pre-trained speech models (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05993">wav2vec</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07447">Hubert</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13900">wavLM</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/radford23a/radford23a.pdf">Whisper</a>, <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/">Conformer-1</a> and <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-2/">Conformer-2</a> ) and other foundation models (e.g. <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o</a>, and <a href="https://stability.ai/stable-image">Stable Diffusion</a>) have advanced rapidly and become more prominent and widespread, improving their efficiency would be more crucial. 
While it is true that the computational power and GPU resources have played a significant role in the success of these models, we need to also be aware that using more computational resources can result in: (a) increasing the cost of training and deploying such models, (b) making the models less accessible, (c) less contribution from the research community, and (d) increasing the environmental costs of the models. Moreover, it is evident that most of these pre-trained models are largely over-parameterized and their efficiency is under question. Lack of efficiency can largely limit the application of these advanced models in practice.</p>
<!-- Pangu-&sum; -->
<p>
Building upon the framework of our previous three editions, this workshop remains dedicated to investigating solutions for enhancing the efficiency of pre-trained language and foundation models but with introducing some fresh and important new topics to the community and encouraging their contributions.
Just to highlight a few: <b>(1)</b> Despite the ubiquitous usage of Transformers, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity which limits their efficiency especially for longer sequence lengths. Should we improve the efficiency of Transformers (e.g. in <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=4g02l2N2Nx">Hedgehog</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06635">Gated Linear Attention</a>) or look for other architectures (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887">Jamba</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048">RVKW</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517">xLSTM</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">SSMs</a>)? <b>(2)</b> For accelerating training, we have seen the significant impact of designing hardware efficient implementations such as in <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">Flash Attention</a>. Should we focus more on these hardware-aware solutions or more on new/improved architectures?
<b>(3)</b> For efficient inference, there are solutions such as: Speculative Decoding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318">[Link1]</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192">[Link2]</a> where the performance is strongly model and task-dependent and the draft and target models should have the same vocabulary (tokenizer); improved KV-caching (e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14048">[Link]</a>) which has a limited speed-up; and many-in-one models such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00255">SortedNet</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707">MatFormer</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16710">LayerSkip</a> but the performance of sub-models drops compared to their corresponding individual models.
<b>(4)</b> While there are many so-called efficient solutions in the literature, there is no fair, comprehensive and practical evaluation of these models and their comparison to each other. For example, we do not know the hallucination extent of the new architectures vs. the transformer model (e.g. in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01032">[Link]</a>).

Investing in the future of language and foundation models requires a concrete effort to enhance their efficiency across multiple dimensions (including architecture, training, and inference) and having a comprehensive evaluation framework. 
To encourage engagement from the NeurIPS community, we present several active research topics in this field that invite participation and contributions. The scope of this workshop includes, but not limited to, the following topics:
<br><br>
<b>Efficient Architectures</b> Proposing alternative architectures that are more efficient than Transformers (in terms of computational complexity, memory footprint, handling longer sequence lengths ) or modifying Transformer architectures to make them more efficient  
<ul>
	<li>Linear and sub-quadratic Transformers , sparse attention Transformers</li>
	<li>New architures for LLMs and foundation models and their scalability</li>
	<li>Evaluation and benchmarking of new architectures (fair comparison of different models)</li>
	<li>Long sequence modeling</li>
	<li>Dense vs. sparse architectures (MoEs)</li>
</ul>
<b>Efficient Training</b> How can we reduce the cost of pre-training or fine-tuning new models?
<ul>	
	<li>More efficient pre-training solutions, from better initialization and hyper-parameter tuning to better optimization which lowers the cost of pre-training</li>
	<li>Parameter efficient fine-tuning  (PEFT) solutions for large pre-trained models</li>
	<li>Efficient instruction tuning,  prompt engineering and in-context learning</li>
	<li>Hardware-aware solutions (e.g. better CUDA kernels), memory read/write aware solutions </li>

<ul>

	<li>Neural model compression techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation</li>
	<li>Improved KV-caching solutions for Transformers</li>
	<li>Distributed inference of large pre-trained models</li>
	<li>Serving many target devices with one model, many-in-one models, early exiting, elastic networks</li>
</ul>
<b>Evaluation and Benchmarking of Efficient Models</b> Introducing new efficient solutions underscores the need for comprehensive benchmarks to accurately evaluate their efficacy and performance. 
<ul>
	<li>Datasets, benchmarks, leaderboards for evaluating efficient models</li>
	<li>Benchmarking the performance of efficient models from different perspectives such as reasoning, hallucination,  understanding, and generation quality </li>
	<li>Benchmarking efficiency of models in terms of their memory footprint, training time, inference time, different target hardware devices and inference platforms (e.g. GPU vs. CPU) </li>
</ul>
<b>Efficient Solutions in other Modalities and Applications </b>
