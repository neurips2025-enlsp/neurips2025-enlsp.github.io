The Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing (ENLSP) Workshop aims to advance the efficiency of large language and speech models across three key dimensions: <b>Model Design</b>, <b>Training</b>, and <b>Inference</b>‚Äîwith a particular emphasis this year on <b>reasoning capabilities</b> and <b>test-time compute</b>.
While enabling models to ``think longer'' has shown promise, they must also <b><i>think smarter</i></b> that requires a stronger focus on efficiency in how models reason and adapt across diverse deployment settings.
ENLSP brings together academic researchers and industry experts in a dynamic program featuring <i>invited talks</i>, <i>panel discussions</i>, peer-reviewed <i>paper</i> and <i>poster presentations</i>, a <i>demo track</i>, and <i>mentorship sessions</i> for new researchers.
The workshop provides a unique opportunity to explore emerging challenges in efficient AI, exchange ideas, and foster collaborations to bring together researchers from the machine learning, systems, optimization, theory and applied AI communities.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16720">OpenAI o1</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948">DeepSeek</a>, 
<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf">Gemini 2.5</a>, 
<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf">GPT-4.5</a>, 
<a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct">Llama 3.3</a>, 
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388">Qwen3</a>), 
alongside traditional speech models (e.g., 
<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf">Nvidia NeMo Parakeet-TDT</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15608">Moonshine</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02832">Samba-ASR</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08093">Amazon BASE TTS</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01710">Spark-TTS</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15687">Meta Voicebox</a>, 
and <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/radford23a/radford23a.pdf">Whisper</a>) 
and modern speech language models (e.g., 
<a href="https://moshi-ai.com/">Moshi</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20215">Qwen2.5-Omni</a>, 
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13289">SALMONN</a>) 
have significantly transformed the field of AI, powering breakthroughs in code generation, scientific discovery, conversational agents, real-time interactions, multimodal integration and beyond. 
Generative models have showcased remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and generating human-like text and speech. 
More recently, a new paradigm has emerged centered on enhancing reasoning abilities through large-scale reinforcement learning 
(e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16720">OpenAI O1</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434">DeepSeek-V2</a>) 
and by scaling test-time compute 
<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute">[Link1]</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787">[Link2]</a>. 
Allocating additional compute during inference effectively allows models to ‚Äú<b>think longer</b>,‚Äù thereby improving their reasoning in a manner akin to human deliberation.
</p>
<p>
These advancements have been fueled by increasingly large model sizes, vast pretraining datasets, and access to powerful GPUs. 
However, this advancement comes at a steep cost: rising computational demands raise serious concerns around scalability, accessibility, and environmental impact. 
A notable example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948">DeepSeek R1</a>, a 671B-parameter reasoning model, with an estimated training cost of <b>$5.6 million</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437">[Link]</a>, far beyond the means of most academic labs. 
Moreover, the growing reliance on increased test-time compute to boost reasoning further worsens the issue, especially as it often requires handling much longer sequences. 
This is particularly challenging for Transformer models, whose compute and memory requirements scale quadratically with sequence length 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12109">[Link1]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14995">[Link2]</a>.
Overcoming these barriers calls for efficiency-focused innovation in model architecture, training strategies, compression, and inference-time optimization, especially for reasoning tasks.
</p>
<p>
Building on the momentum of previous editions, this year‚Äôs workshop continues to advance the efficiency of language and speech models, while introducing several timely and impactful directions to address emerging challenges and broaden community engagement:
</p>

<p><strong>(1) Efficient Architectures:</strong> 
We spotlight architectures that balance performance with computational and memory efficiency. While Transformers dominate, their quadratic attention and KV cache overhead limit scalability 
<a href="xxx">Zhang et al. 2023</a>. 
New directions include sub-quadratic models (e.g., 
<a href="xxx">Mamba</a>, 
<a href="xxx">Hedgehog</a>, 
<a href="xxx">xLSTM</a>, 
and <a href="xxx">RVKW</a>), hybrid designs (e.g., 
<a href="xxx">Jamba</a>, 
<a href="xxx">Nemotron-H</a>), and diffusion-based language models 
<a href="xxx">Nie et al. 2025</a>, 
<a href="xxx">Li et al. 2025</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>(2) Custom Model Composition:</strong> 
As applications diversify, we need modular, efficient frameworks that adapt pre-trained models without full retraining. This enables customization across hardware and user needs, beyond what compression or NAS alone can offer 
<a href="xxx">Muralidharan et al. 2024</a>, 
<a href="xxx">Bercovich et al. 2025a</a>, 
<a href="xxx">Bercovich et al. 2025b</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>(3) Efficient Training and Knowledge Transfer:</strong> 
Efficient models often rely on expensive training (e.g., 
<a href="xxx">Samba</a> and 
<a href="xxx">Hymba</a>, which involve pre-training) or suffer from poor transfer (e.g., 
<a href="xxx">MambaInLLaMA</a>). We invite solutions for effective post-training adaptation, and KV compression that preserve model quality at lower cost.
</p>

<p><strong>(4) Efficient Reasoning Models:</strong> 
Models like OpenAI‚Äôs O1 and DeepSeek show promise in reasoning, but their pipelines (training regimes, data curation, and design decisions) remain opaque. We encourage work that improves transparency and efficiency of reasoning models across training, data, inference, and deployment.
</p>

<p><strong>(5) Adaptive Test-Time Compute:</strong> 
Reasoning often benefits from increased inference compute. We seek methods like speculative decoding (e.g., multi-branch CoT) and adaptive compute allocation to extend ‚Äúthinking time‚Äù based on task complexity without incurring quadratic costs.
</p>

<p><strong>(6) Evaluation and Benchmarking:</strong> 
Robust, compute-aware evaluation is essential. We seek evaluation methodologies that incorporate compute-aware metrics‚Äîsuch as latency-quality trade-offs, and energy efficiency‚Äîto assess models under practical deployment conditions, including edge and low-power scenarios.
</p>

<p>
Building upon the framework of our previous three editions, this workshop remains dedicated to investigating solutions for enhancing the efficiency of pre-trained language and foundation models but with introducing some fresh and important new topics to the community and encouraging their contributions.
Just to highlight a few: <b>(1)</b> Despite the ubiquitous usage of Transformers, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity which limits their efficiency especially for longer sequence lengths. Should we improve the efficiency of Transformers (e.g. in <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=4g02l2N2Nx">Hedgehog</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06635">Gated Linear Attention</a>) or look for other architectures (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887">Jamba</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048">RVKW</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517">xLSTM</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">SSMs</a>)? <b>(2)</b> For accelerating training, we have seen the significant impact of designing hardware efficient implementations such as in <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">Flash Attention</a>. Should we focus more on these hardware-aware solutions or more on new/improved architectures?
<b>(3)</b> For efficient inference, there are solutions such as: Speculative Decoding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318">[Link1]</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192">[Link2]</a> where the performance is strongly model and task-dependent and the draft and target models should have the same vocabulary (tokenizer); improved KV-caching (e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14048">[Link]</a>) which has a limited speed-up; and many-in-one models such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00255">SortedNet</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707">MatFormer</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16710">LayerSkip</a> but the performance of sub-models drops compared to their corresponding individual models.
<b>(4)</b> While there are many so-called efficient solutions in the literature, there is no fair, comprehensive and practical evaluation of these models and their comparison to each other. For example, we do not know the hallucination extent of the new architectures vs. the transformer model (e.g. in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01032">[Link]</a>).
