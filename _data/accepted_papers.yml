"title": "Snakes and Ladders: Accelerating State Space Model Inference with Speculative Decoding",
"abstract": "Speculative decoding is a method for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs) by predicting multiple tokens using a smaller ‘draft model’ and validating them against the larger ‘base model.’ If a draft token is inconsistent with what the base model would have generated, speculative decoding ‘backtracks’ to the last consistent token before resuming generation. This is straightforward in autoregressive Transformer architectures since their state is a sliding window of past tokens. However, their baseline inference complexity is quadratic in the number of input tokens. State Space Models (SSMs) have linear inference complexity, but they maintain a separate Markov state that makes backtracking non-trivial. We propose two methods to perform speculative decoding in SSMs: “Joint Attainment and Advancement” and “Activation Replay.” Both methods utilize idle computational resources to speculate and verify multiple tokens, allowing us to produce 6 tokens for 1.47⇥ the cost of one, corresponding to an average 1.82⇥ wall-clock speed-up on three different benchmarks using a simple n-gram for drafting. Furthermore, as model size increases, relative overhead of speculation and verification decreases: Scaling from 1.3B parameters to 13B reduces relative overhead from 1.98⇥ to 1.22⇥. Unlike Transformers, speculative decoding in SSMs can be easily applied to batches of sequences, allowing dynamic allocation of resources to fill gaps in compute utilization and thereby improving efficiency and throughput with variable inference traffic.",

"title": "GEAR: An Efficient Error Reduction Framework for KV Cache Compression in LLM Inference",
"abstract": "Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto technique to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing entries group-wise. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient error reduction framework that augments a quantization scheme with two error reduction components and achieves near-lossless performance at high compression ratios. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low-rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments show that GEAR can maintain similar accuracy to that of FP16 cache with improvement up to 24.42% over the SOTA baselines at 2-bit compression. Additionally, compared to LLM inference with FP16 KV cache, GEAR can reduce peak-memory of up to 2.39×, bringing 2.1× ∼ 5.07× throughput improvement. Our code will be publicly available.",

"title": "One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation",
"abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine- tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to modulate the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of newly introduced weights. These weight matrices are usually initialized at random with the same rank for each layer across the FM, which results in suboptimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner, by computing singular value decomposition on activation vectors. Then, we initialize the new LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors. Finally, we re-distribute the ranks among layers to explain the maximal amount of variance across all layers. This assignment results in an adaptive allocation of ranks per weight matrix, and inherits all benefits of LoRA. We apply our new method, Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), to a variety of fine-tuning tasks comprising language understanding and generation, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA consistently attains the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain.",

"abstract": "Recently published work on rephrasing natural text data for pre-training LLMs has shown promising results when combining the original dataset with the synthetically rephrased data. We build upon previous work by replicating existing results on C4 and extending them with our optimized rephrasing pipeline to the English, German, Italian, and Spanish Oscar subsets of CulturaX. Our pipeline leads to increased performance on stan- dard evaluation benchmarks in both the mono- and multilingual setup. In addition, we provide a detailed study of our pipeline, investigating the choice of the base dataset and LLM for the rephrasing, as well as the relationship between the model size and the performance after pre-training. By exploring data with different perceived quality levels, we show that gains decrease with higher quality. Furthermore, we find the difference in performance between model families to be bigger than between different model sizes. This highlights the necessity for detailed tests before choosing an LLM to rephrase large amounts of data. Moreover, we investigate the effect of pre-training with synthetic data on supervised fine-tuning. Here, we find in- creasing but inconclusive results that highly depend on the used benchmark. These results (again) highlight the need for better benchmarking setups. In summary, we show that rephrasing multilingual and low-quality data is a very promising direction to extend LLM pre-training data.",

"abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory con- sumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose T HIN K, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, T HIN K integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8× reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5× increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive eval- uations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of T HIN K, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.",

"abstract": "Recent advancements in Transformer-based language models have spurred interest, in their use for biological sequence analysis. However, adapting models like BERT, is challenging due to sequence length, often requiring truncation for proteomics, and genomics tasks. Additionally, advanced tokenization and relative positional, encoding techniques for long contexts in NLP are often not directly transferable, to DNA/RNA sequences, which require nucleotide or character-level encodings, for tasks such as 3D torsion angle prediction, distance map prediction or sec-, ondary structure prediction. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adaptive, dual tokenimzation scheme for bioinformatics that utilizes both nucleotide-level, (NUC) and efficient BPE tokenizations. Building on the dual tokenization, we, introduce BiRNA-BERT, a 117M parameter Transformer encoder pretrained with, our proposed tokenization on 28 billion nucleotides across 36 million coding, and non-coding RNA sequences. The learned representation by BiRNA-BERT, generalizes across a range of applications. The BiRNA-BERT model achieves, state-of-the-art results in long-sequence downstream tasks, performs comparably, well in short-sequence tasks, and matches the performance in nucleotide-level, structural prediction tasks, of models six times larger in parameter size, while, requiring 27 times less pre-training compute. In addition, our empirical experi-, ments and ablation studies demonstrate that NUC is often preferable over BPE, for bioinformatics tasks, given sufficient VRAM availability. We further demon-, strate the applicability of the dual-pretraning and adaptive tokenization strategy, employing this concept on a DNA language model which provides comparable, performance to 66X compute heavy DNA language models. BiRNA-BERT can, dynamically adjust its tokenization strategy based on sequence lengths, utilizing, NUC for shorter sequences and switching to BPE for longer ones, thereby offering, for the first time, the capability to efficiently handle arbitrarily long DNA/RNA sequences.",

In this paper, we challenge a trend equating query and question,, and instead conceptualize query generation task as a “compilation” of high-level, intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we propose EGG, a query generator, that better adapts to wide search intents expressed in the BeIR benchmark. Our, method outperforms baselines and existing models on four tasks with underexplored, intents, while utilizing a query generator 47 times smaller than the previous state-, of-the-art. Our findings reveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is, a key aspect of modeling an effective query generator.",

This paper introduces distributed speculative, inference (DSI), a novel distributed inference algorithm that is provably faster than, speculative inference (SI) [Leviathan et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2023, Miao et al.,, 2023] and traditional autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms,, DSI works on frozen LLMs, requiring no training or architectural modifications,, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated, empirical speedups (compared to non-SI) but require a fast and accurate drafter, LLM. In practice, off-the-shelf LLMs often do not have matching drafters that are, sufficiently fast and accurate. We show a gap: SI gets slower than non-SI when, using slower or less accurate drafters. We close this gap by proving that DSI is, faster than both SI and non-SI—given any drafters. By orchestrating multiple, instances of the target and drafters, DSI is not only faster than SI but also supports, LLMs that cannot be accelerated with SI. Our simulations show speedups of off-, the-shelf LLMs in realistic settings: DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI. Our code is, open-sourced: github.com/keyboardAnt/Distributed-Speculative-Inference",

"abstract": "Prompts are often employed to condition decoder-only language model generation, on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to, the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However,, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model, parameters. When the right context is not known in advance, caching the prompt, can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models, that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition, generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage, pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers., We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models, to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform prompt-based, inference methods, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drasti-, cally reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of, magnitude. Specifically, we introduced XC-L LAMA which converts a pre-trained, L LAMA 2 into an encoder-decoder architecture by integrating cross-attention layers, interleaved in between existing self-attention layers.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness, of pruning transformer-based speech models without post-training, achieving up, to 40% reduction in transformer layers while maintaining 95% of the model’s, predictive capacity.

"abstract": "Speculative decoding [1] is a powerful technique that attempts to circumvent the, autoregressive constraint of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The aim of, speculative decoding techniques is to improve the average inference time of a large,, target model without sacrificing its accuracy, by using a more efficient draft model, to propose draft tokens which are then verified in parallel. The number of draft, tokens produced in each drafting round is referred to as the draft length and is often, a static hyperparameter chosen based on the acceptance rate statistics of the draft, tokens. However, setting a static draft length can negatively impact performance,, especially in scenarios where drafting is expensive and there is a high variance in the, number of tokens accepted. Adaptive Entropy-based Draft Length (AdaEDL) is a, simple, training and parameter-free criteria which allows for early stopping of the, token drafting process by approximating a lower bound on the expected acceptance, probability of the drafted token based on the currently observed entropy of the, drafted logits. We show that AdaEDL consistently outperforms static draft-length, speculative decoding by 10%-57% as well as other training-free draft-stopping, techniques by upto 10% in a variety of settings and datasets. At the same time, we, show that AdaEDL is more robust than these techniques and preserves performance, in high-sampling-temperature scenarios. Since it is training-free, in contrast to, techniques that rely on the training of dataset-specific draft-stopping predictors,, AdaEDL can seamlessly be integrated into a variety of pre-existing LLM systems.",

"abstract": "Deployment of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) is costly, and as these models increase in size, the associated costs will become even more considerable. Consequently, different methods have been proposed to accelerate the token generation process and reduce costs. Speculative decoding (SD) is among the most promising approaches to speed up the LLM decoding process by verifying multiple tokens in parallel and using an auxiliary smaller draft model to generate the possible tokens. In SD, usually one draft model is used to serve a specific target model; however, in practice, LLMs are diverse, and we might need to deal with many target models or more than one target model simultaneously. In this scenario, it is not clear which draft model should be used for which target model, and searching among different draft models, or training customized draft models, can further increase deployment costs. In this paper, we first introduce a novel multi-target scenario for deployment of draft models for faster inference. Then, we present a novel more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target setting. We evaluated our method on Spec-Bench in different settings including base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and LLama Chat 70B.

With, the adoption of techniques from natural language processing (NLP), such as lan-, guage model-based approaches, DL models for tabular data have also grown in, complexity and size. Although tabular datasets do not typically pose scalability, issues, the escalating size of these models has raised efficiency concerns.

"title": "Scaling Smart: Accelerating Large Language Model Pre-training with Small Model Initialization",
"abstract": "The pre-training phase of language models often begins with randomly initialized, parameters. With the current trends in scaling models, training their large number, of parameters can be extremely slow and costly. In contrast, small language models, are less expensive to train, but they often cannot achieve the accuracy of large, models. In this paper, we explore an intriguing idea to connect these two different, regimes: Can we develop a method to initialize large language models using, smaller pre-trained models? Will such initialization bring any benefits in terms, of training time and final accuracy? In this paper, we introduce HyperCloning, a, method that can expand the parameters of a pre-trained language model to those, of a larger model with increased hidden dimensions. Our method ensures that, the larger model retains the functionality of the smaller model. As a result, the, larger model already inherits the predictive power and accuracy of the smaller, model before the training starts. We demonstrate that training such an initialized, model results in significant savings in terms of GPU hours required for pre-training, large language models. Implementation of HyperCloning is available at https:, //github.com/apple/ml-hypercloning/tree/main.",

"abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread dissemination of, misinformation across multiple content forms, including text, images, audio, and, video. Compared to unimodal misinformation detection, multimodal misinfor-, mation detection benefits from the increased availability of information across, multiple modalities. However, these additional features may introduce redundancy,, where overlapping or irrelevant information is included, potentially disrupting the, feature space and consequently impairing the model’s performance. To address, the issue, we propose a novel framework, Misinformation Detection Mixture of, Experts (MisD-MoE), which employs distinct expert models for each modality, and incorporates an adaptive feature selection mechanism using top-k gating and, Gumbel-Sigmoid. This approach dynamically filters relevant features, reducing re-, dundancy and improving detection accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective trick to enhance, SSMs within given computational budgets by sparsifying them. Our intuition is, that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due to gradual recurrent updates, and, dense recurrence operations block the delivery of past information. In particular,, we observe that upper layers of SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode, global information, while lower layers encode local information. Motivated by this,, we introduce Simba, a hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token, pruning. Simba sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the, upper layers to behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token, pruning criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final, output by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms, the baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language, tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only, enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long sequences.",

In, this work, we systematically evaluate both lines of research on a range of metrics,, including validation perplexity, memory usage and throughput. Additionally, we, propose improvements on both low-rank decomposition methods, by improving, the low-rank matrices decomposition and initialization, and memory efficient opti-, mizer methods via the introduction of error feedback and dynamic update steps., Our comprehensive evaluation under the same experimental setting shows that, our proposed optimizations outperform all previous methods, achieving almost, same throughput as full-rank training, saving 9% in memory traded off for a 1.5%, increase in validation perplexity.",

To further improve efficiency,, Multi-Candidate Speculative Decoding (MCSD) improves upon this by sampling, multiple candidate tokens from the draft model at each step and verifying them, in parallel, thus increasing the chances of accepting a token and reducing gen-, eration time. Existing MCSD methods rely on the draft model to initialize the, multi-candidate sequences and use static length and tree attention structure for, draft generation.

However, alignment differs from the afore-mentioned paradigms, and it is unclear if data efficient alignment is feasible. In this work, we first aim, to understand how the performance of LLM alignment scales with data. We find, out that LLM alignment performance follows an exponential plateau pattern which, tapers off post a rapid initial increase. Based on this, we identify data subsampling, as a viable method to reduce resources required for alignment. Further, we propose, an information theory-based methodology for efficient alignment by identifying, a small high quality subset thereby reducing the computation and time required, by alignment. We evaluate the proposed methodology over multiple datasets, and compare the results. We find that the model aligned using our proposed, methodology outperforms other sampling methods and performs comparable to, the model aligned with the full dataset while using less than 10% data, leading to, greater than 90% savings in costs, resources, and faster LLM alignment.",

"abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context, tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses, significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache, compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which, have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance, degradation. Other methods design new architectures with le ss KV overhead but, require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we, further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-, level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-, efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first, analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant, redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this, observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers, and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we, introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache, and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we, minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead, of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce, the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model’s long-, context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined, with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression, ratio of up to 95%.

We address this by proposing Crossencoders with Joint Efficient Modeling (CROSS-JEM), a novel ranking approach that enables transformer-based models to jointly score multiple items for a query, maximizing parameter utilization. CROSS-JEM leverages (a) redundancies and token overlaps to jointly score multiple items, that are typically short-text phrases arising in search and recommendations, and (b) a novel training objective that models ranking probabilities.

As the number of downstream tasks grows, draft models add significant complexity to inference systems. Recently several single model architectures viz. Medusa have been proposed to speculate tokens in non-autoregressive manner, however, their effectiveness is limited due to lack of dependency between speculated tokens. We introduce a novel speculative decoding method that integrates drafting within the target model by using Multi-stream attention and incorporates future token planning into supervised finetuning objective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parameter-efficient approach that scales well with an increasing number of downstream tasks while enhancing downstream metrics and achieving high acceptance rates, attributable to the interdependence among the speculated tokens. Speculative Streaming speeds up decoding by 1.9 - 3X in a diverse set of tasks, such as Summarization, Structured Queries, and Meaning Representation, while improving generation quality and using ∼10000X fewer extra parameters than alternative architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained devices.

These, methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-, rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called, adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In, this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We, show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA is, equivalent to injecting some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter, parameters, and we quantify the variance of the injected noise. By establishing a, Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of, the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show, that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private, fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show, that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to, performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters., These theoretical findings suggest that unlike other existing fine-tuning algorithms,, low-rank adaptation provides privacy w.r.t the fine-tuning data implicitly.",

"abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive study and propose several novel tech-, niques for implementing 3D convolutional blocks using 2D and/or 1D convolutions, with only 4D and/or 3D tensors. Our motivation is that 3D convolutions with 5D, tensors are computationally very expensive and they may not be supported by some, of the edge devices used in real-time applications such as robots. The existing, approaches mitigate this by splitting the 3D kernels into spatial and temporal do-, mains, but they still use 3D convolutions with 5D tensors in their implementations., We resolve this issue by introducing some appropriate 4D/3D tensor reshaping as, well as new combination techniques for spatial and temporal splits. The proposed, implementation methods show significant improvement both in terms of efficiency, and accuracy. The experimental results confirm that the proposed spatio-temporal, processing structure outperforms the original model in terms of speed and accuracy, using only 4D tensors with fewer parameters.",

[16]. Traditional approaches to mitigate this, issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation func-, tions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an, efficient activation function designed to address the “dying ReLU” problem with, minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds, for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the, backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to, achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts, without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Em-, pirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across, diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference, suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.",

We explore the design choices of this class of algorithms using both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on downstream tasks. Our motivating examples are sparsity algorithms for language models, which often use top-k to select the most important parameters or activations.

"abstract": "The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV Cache size involve either finetuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the L2 norm and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low L2 norm of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV Cache based on the L2 norm of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV Cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.",

"abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) typically generate outputs token by token using a fixed compute budget, leading to inefficient resource utilization. To address this shortcoming, recent advancements in mixture of expert (MoE) models, speculative decoding, and early exit strategies leverage the insight that computational demands can vary significantly based on the complexity and nature of the input. However, identifying optimal routing patterns for dynamic execution remains an open challenge, limiting the full potential of these adaptive methods. To address this need, we study adaptive computation in LLMs more systematically. We propose a novel framework that integrates smaller auxiliary modules within each Feed-Forward Network layer of the LLM. This design enables dynamic routing of tokens based on task complexity: tokens can be processed by either the small or big modules at each layer, or even bypass certain layers entirely. This allows us to introduce a novel notion of a token’s difficulty, defined by its potential to benefit from additional computational resources. Importantly, by employing oracles to identify optimal patterns of adaptive computations, we gain valuable insights into the internal workings of LLMs and the routing processes in a simplified heterogeneous MoE setup. We show that trained routers operate differently from oracles and often yield suboptimal solutions. Notably, activating a large module in just one layer outperforms models that use large modules across all layers, underscoring the gap between practical implementations of routing in MoE models and theoretical optima for adaptive computation.",

This paper, proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention, computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic, sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate, nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and, retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortu-, nately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for, such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors, and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD, challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to, the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAtten-, tion achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1–3% of, the data.

Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and, the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our, experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves, the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining, competitive performance.",

"title": "FastDraft: How to Train Your Draft",
"abstract": "Speculative Decoding has gained popularity as an effective technique for accelerating the auto-regressive inference process of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, Speculative Decoding entirely relies on the availability of efficient draft models, which are often lacking for many existing language models due to a stringent constraint of vocabulary incompatibility. In this work we introduce FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training, followed by finetuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model. We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for the popular Phi-3- mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able to produce a draft with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single server with 8 accelerators in under 24 hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key metrics of acceptance rate, block efficiency and up to 3x memory bound speed up when evaluated on code completion and up to 2x in summarization, text completion and instruction tasks. Due to its high quality, FastDraft unlocks large language models inference on AI-PC and other edge-devices.",

"title": "Lightweight Neural Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition using Layer-wise Adaptive Quantization",
"abstract": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems are essential in advancing human-, machine interaction. While deep learning models have shown substantial success in, SER by eliminating the need for handcrafted features, their high computational and, memory requirements, alongside intensive hyper-parameter optimization, limit their, deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, we, introduce an optimized and computationally efficient Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-, based classifier within a custom SER framework. We further propose a novel,, layer-wise adaptive quantization scheme that compresses the model by adjusting bit-, width precision according to layer importance. This layer importance is calculated, based on statistical measures such as parameter proportion, entropy, and weight, variance within each layer. Our approach achieves an optimal balance between, model size reduction and performance retention, ensuring that the quantized model, maintains accuracy within acceptable limits. Traditional fixed-precision methods,, while computationally simple, are less effective at reducing model size without, compromising performance. In contrast, our scheme provides a more interpretable, and computationally efficient solution. We evaluate the proposed model on standard, SER datasets using features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC),, Chroma, and Mel-spectrogram. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive, quantization method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing model size, making it highly suitable for deployment, on edge devices.",

"title": "LORC: Low-Rank Compression for LLMs KV Cache with a Progressive Compression Strategy",
"abstract": "The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based, autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing, previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales lin-, early with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM, deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient atten-, tion variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter, tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test, time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer, dependencies and can be task-specific., This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We, propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-, in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining., To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise, sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by, our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks., Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or, task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models, ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach, significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.",

"abstract": "Soft prompt tuning techniques have recently gained traction as an effective strat-, egy for the parameter-efficient tuning of pretrained language models, particularly, minimizing the required adjustment of model parameters. Despite their growing, use, achieving optimal tuning with soft prompts, especially for smaller datasets,, remains a substantial challenge. This study makes two contributions in this do-, main: (i) we introduce S UPER P OS -P ROMPT, a new reparameterization technique, employing the superposition of multiple pretrained vocabulary embeddings to, improve the learning of soft prompts. Our experiments across several GLUE and, SuperGLUE benchmarks consistently highlight S UPER P OS -P ROMPT’s superior-, ity over Residual Prompt tuning, exhibiting an average score increase of +6.4, in T5-Small and +5.0 in T5-Base along with a faster convergence. Remarkably,, S UPER P OS -P ROMPT occasionally outperforms even full fine-tuning methods. (ii), Additionally, we demonstrate enhanced performance and rapid convergence by, omitting dropouts from the frozen network, yielding consistent improvements, across various scenarios and tuning methods.",

"title": "Revisiting SMoE Language Models by Evaluating Inefficiencies with Task Specific Expert Pruning",
"abstract": "Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) models have emerged as a scalable alterna-, tive to dense models in language modeling. These models use conditionally ac-, tivated feedforward subnetworks in transformer blocks, allowing for a separation, between total model parameters and per-example computation. However, large, token-routed SMoE models face a significant challenge: during inference, the en-, tire model must be used for a sequence or a batch, resulting in high latencies, in a distributed setting that offsets the advantages of per-token sparse activation., Our research explores task-specific model pruning to inform decisions about de-, signing SMoE architectures, mainly modulating the choice of expert counts in, pretraining. We investigate whether such pruned models offer advantages over, smaller SMoE models trained from scratch, when evaluating and comparing them, individually on tasks. To that end, we introduce an adaptive task-aware pruning, technique UNCURL to reduce the number of experts per MoE layer in an offline, manner post-training. Our findings reveal a threshold pruning factor for the re-, duction that depends on the number of experts used in pretraining, above which,, the reduction starts to degrade model performance. These insights contribute to, our understanding of model design choices when pretraining with SMoE architec-, tures, particularly useful when considering task-specific inference optimization, for later stages.",

"abstract": "While transformers have been at the core of most recent advancements in sequence, generative models, their computational cost remains quadratic in sequence length., Several subquatratic architectures have been proposed to address this computational, issue. Some of them, including long convolution sequence models (LCSMs), such, as Hyena, address this issue at training time but remain quadratic during inference., We propose a method for speeding up LCSMs’ inference to quasilinear time, iden-, tify the key properties that make this possible, and propose a general framework, that exploits these. Our approach, inspired by previous work on relaxed polynomial, interpolation, is based on a tiling which helps decrease memory movement and, share computation. It has the added benefit of allowing for almost complete paral-, lelization across layers of the position-mixing part of the architecture. Empirically,, we provide a proof of concept implementation for Hyena-like settings, which gets, up to 4× improvement over standard inference.",
