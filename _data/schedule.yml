  Bio: <b>Navdeep Jaitly</b> is a Research Scientist at Apple Machine Learning Research (MLR) where he leads a team of researchers working on fundamental techniques in Machine Learning with an emphasis on speech and language. He got his PhD from University of Toronto, under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton in the foundational days of Deep Learning. During a PhD internship at Google in 2011 he demonstrated how Deep Neural Networks would revolutionize speech recognition replacing HMM systems that were in use before. After his PhD he joined Google Brain working on sequence models and techniques such as Listen Attend and Spell, Adversarial Autoencoders and Pointer Networks. He has also held machine learning research positions at Nvidia, Google Brain Robotics (initiating robotic ping pong), D. E. Shaw and the National Labs.
  Abstract: It is well accepted now that speech needs to be tokenized before it can be modeled with transformer based generative models. In fact there is a rich body of intricate work using semantic and other acoustic tokens for speech modeling. In this talk we show how tokenization may not be necessary and that, indeed, a simple way of discretizing Mel-spectrograms (which we call d-Mel) is enough to build generative models with transformers. We show how we can build conditional generative models of speech (text-to-speech) using d-Mel and transformer based models. We also demonstrate that the same technique can be applied to multi-modal generation of speech conditioned on text and video. It is our hope that this leads to more exploration on minimal preprocessing of speech for use in generative modeling.

  Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long sequences.

  Abstract: Modern large language models are built on sequence modeling via next-token prediction.<br/>While the Transformer remains the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, its quadratic decoding complexity in sequence length poses a major limitation. State-space models (SSMs) present a competitive alternative, offering linear decoding efficiency while maintaining parallelism during training. However, most existing SSMs rely on linear recurrence designs that appear somewhat ad hoc.<br/>In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from solving these objectives.<br/>Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture, Longhorn, whose update resembles the closed-form solution for solving the online associative recall problem. Our experimental results show that Longhorn outperforms state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks, language modeling, and vision tasks. Specifically, Longhorn achieves a 1.8x improvement in sample efficiency compared to Mamba, and can extrapolate over contexts that are up to 16x longer during inference.

  Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto technique to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing entries group-wise. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient error reduction framework that augments a quantization scheme with two error reduction components and achieves near-lossless performance at high compression ratios. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low-rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments show that GEAR can maintain similar accuracy to that of FP16 cache with improvement up to 24.42% over the SOTA baselines at 2-bit compression. Additionally, compared to LLM inference with FP16 KV cache, GEAR can reduce peak-memory of up to $2.39\times$, bringing $2.1\times\sim 5.07\times$ throughput improvement. Our code will be publicly available.

  Abstract: We introduce Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs) to improve the performance and efficiency of transformer foundation models. NAMMs are evolved atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts containing the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the attention matrices produced in each layer. NAMMs learned on a relatively small set of problems substantially improve performance across multiple unseen long-context language tasks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes, setting them apart from prior hand-designed KV cache eviction strategies that only aim to preserve model behavior. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.

  Abstract: We introduce OLMoE, a fully open, state-of-the-art language model leveraging sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). OLMoE-1B-7B has 7 billion (B) parameters but uses only 1B per input token. We pretrain it on 5 trillion tokens and further adapt it to create OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct. Our models outperform all available models with similar active parameters, even surpassing larger ones like Llama2- 13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B. We present novel findings on MoE training, define and analyze new routing properties showing high specialization in our model, and open-source all our work&#58; model weights, training data, code, and logs.

  Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

  Abstract: We present Statistical Calibrated Activation Pruning (SCAP), a post-training activation pruning framework that (1) generalizes sparsification by input activations of Fully-Connected layers for generic and flexible application across Transformers, and (2) features a simple Mode-Centering technique to pre-calibrate activation distributions for maximizing post-training sparsity. Our results demonstrate robust Pareto efficiency compared to prior methods, translating to a 1.5× additional LLM decoding speedup against CATS[12] at iso model quality. SCAP effectiveness is empirically verified across a wide range of models, including recent Transformer Decoders, MoE, Mamba2, Encoding Transformer, and pre-quantized models, highlighting its practicality and scalability. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/SCAP.

  Abstract: Language models for biological and chemical sequences enable crucial applications such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Currently, these language models are predominantly based on Transformer architectures. While Transformers have yielded impressive results, their quadratic runtime dependency on sequence length complicates their use for long genomic sequences and in-context learning on proteins and chemical sequences. Recently, the recurrent xLSTM architecture has been shown to perform favorably compared to Transformers and modern state-space models (SSMs) in the natural language domain. Similar to SSMs, xLSTMs have linear runtime dependency and allow for constant-memory decoding at inference time, which makes them prime candidates for modeling long-range dependencies in biological and chemical sequences. In this work, we tailor xLSTM towards these domains and we propose a suite of language models called Bio-xLSTM. Extensive experiments in three large domains, genomics, proteins, and chemistry, were performed to assess xLSTM's ability to model biological and chemical sequences. The results show that Bio-xLSTM is a highly proficient generative model for DNA, protein, and chemical sequences, learns rich representations, and can perform in-context learning for proteins and small molecules.

  Abstract: The size of the key-value (KV) cache plays a critical role in determining both the maximum context length and the number of concurrent requests supported during inference in modern language models. The KV cache size grows proportionally with the number of attention heads and the tokens processed, leading to increased memory consumption and slower inference for long inputs. In this work, we explore the use of MixAttention, a model architecture modification closely related to a blog published by Character.AI. MixAttention combines sliding window attention, where only a small subset of recent tokens is stored in the KV cache, with KV cache sharing across layers. Our experiments demonstrate that MixAttention significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed without sacrificing model performance in both short and long-context tasks. We also explore various configurations of this architecture, identifying those that maintain quality across evaluation metrics while optimizing resource efficiency.

  Abstract: Language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous in both AI research and commercial product offerings. As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. In this talk, I present our OLMo project aimed at building strong language models and making them fully accessible to researchers along with open-source code for data, training, and inference. Training language models are expensive, therefore we optimize for quality vs. compute cost. I focus on how data, architecture, and training improvements advance models at pre-training and post-training stages with less compute cost.
